# web-wordle

A Wordle web application. In this version of Wordle, you can earn points and set highscores depending on how well you guess.

## Getting Started
The frontend is built on Astro, which needs Node.js to operate.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :----------------------| :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

The backend uses Java SpringBoot.
